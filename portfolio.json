    "summary": "Experienced full-stack web developer with over 8 years of expertise in PHP and Laravel development. I have strong proficiency in modern frontend frameworks including React (Next.js), Vue (Nuxt.js), and Svelte (SvelteKit), along with a preference for Tailwind CSS though I'm adaptable to any CSS framework. Beyond coding, I bring experience in team leadership, mentorship, and architecting scalable applications. I'm passionate about best practices including TDD, CI/CD, and Docker-based development. I prioritize security, code quality, and collaborative teamwork, and I'm always eager to learn and grow under exceptional leadership."
